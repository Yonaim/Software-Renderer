# Software-Renderer

A simple software renderer implemented in C++ without any external libraries.

## Features
- Written in C++ without using any external libraries (only standard C and C++ libraries).
- Works similarly to OpenGL and DirectX, but implemented purely in software.
- Uses the Phong shading model (subject to change in future updates).
